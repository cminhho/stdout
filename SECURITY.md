## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please report it responsibly:

- **Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.
- Email the maintainers (see main README or repository owner) with a description and steps to reproduce, if possible.
- Allow time for a fix before any public disclosure.

We will acknowledge your report and work on a fix. We appreciate your help in keeping Stdout and its users safe.
